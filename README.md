## General info
It's a simple application for adding decimal numbers. In this Project Binary
Calculator was added by other Developer. I made Decimal Calculator. 
 Both calculators work the same. We can add to numbers. After overflow the field in result row
 (more than 9) we move 1 left and leave rest in filed). E.x 9+3 = 12. 
 We move 1 next to the field and leave 2 in result field.
